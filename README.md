[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and **scale** a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks. 

Amazon Redshift uses SQL to analyze structured and semi-structured data across **data warehouses**, operational databases, and data lakes, using AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price performance at any scale.

Amazon S3 Glacier is an online file storage web service that provides storage for data archiving and backup. Glacier is part of the Amazon Web Services suite of cloud computing services, and is designed for long-term storage of data that is infrequently accessed and for which retrieval latency times of 3 to 5 hours are acceptable.

Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for data archiving and long-term backup.

With S3 Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or even decades. S3 Glacier enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations. 

**Latency**: Latency is the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another. Suppose Server A in New York sends a data packet to Server B in London. Server A sends the packet at 04:38:00.000 GMT and Server B receives it at 04:38:00.145 GMT. The amount of latency on this path is the difference between these two times: 0.145 seconds or 145 milliseconds ([CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/)).
